            "As you'll see in the next steps, the LED rings are staggered within the sphere, forming a staircase like\n",
            "structure. Meanwhile, each ring has a single 5V, GND, DI (LED data in), and DO (LED data out) pad.\n",
            "This creates a soldering challenge, as you need to connect all the rings GND and 5V pads together,\n",
            "while also zigzagging the data line and keeping the rings separated enough to fit in the sphere\n",
            "correctly.\n",
            "To make the ring connection process \"easier\", I designed a \"ring joiner\" PCB (pictured in this step),\n",
            "which does all the GND/5V/Data line work for you. The PCBs solder vertically to the LED rings'\n",
            "connection pads using the PCB's bottom \"half-holes\", while the two rows of through-holes are sized\n",
            "for common 2.54mm male headers. Likewise, the holes are spaced vertically to match the heights of\n",
            "the rings in the sphere. So by adding male headers to each of the rings' pads, they can be connected\n",
            "and staggered all using the single PCB.\n",
            "The ring joiner PCB literally just does connections, so each numbered pin on the PCB connects to all\n",
            "other pins with the same number. The pin layout may look a little wacky, but it's designed to\n",
            "accommodate the ring connections from the wiring diagram (with the LED data running from bottom to\n",

            "data flow. Make sure you pay close attention to the PCB in ring assembly images!\n",
